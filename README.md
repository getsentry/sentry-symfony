## Benefits

Use `sentry-symfony` for:

 * A fast Sentry setup
 * Easy configuration in your Symfony app
 * Automatic wiring in your app. Each event has the following things added automatically to it:
   - user
   - Symfony environment
   - app path
   - excluded paths (cache and vendor)

## Installation

To install the SDK you will need to be using [Composer]([https://getcomposer.org/)
in your project. To install it please see the [docs](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry-symfony
```

If you're using the [Symfony Flex](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/flex.html) Composer plugin, it could show a message similar to this:

```
The recipe for this package comes from the "contrib" repository, which is open to community contributions.
Review the recipe at https://github.com/symfony/recipes-contrib/tree/master/sentry/sentry-symfony/3.0

Do you want to execute this recipe?
```

Just type `y`, press return, and the procedure will continue.

**Warning:** due to a bug in all versions lower than `6.0` of the [`SensioFrameworkExtra`](https://github.com/sensiolabs/SensioFrameworkExtraBundle) bundle,
if you have it installed you will likely get an error during the execution of the commands above in regards to the missing `Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory`
class. To workaround the issue, if you are not using the PSR-7 bridge, please change the configuration of that bundle as follows:

```yaml
sensio_framework_extra:
   psr_message:
      enabled: false
```

For more details about the issue see https://github.com/sensiolabs/SensioFrameworkExtraBundle/pull/710.

### Step 2: Enable the Bundle

If you installed the package using the Flex recipe, the bundle will be automatically enabled. Otherwise, enable it by adding it to the list
of registered bundles in the `Kernel.php` file of your project:

```php
class AppKernel extends \Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles(): array
    {
        return [
            // ...
            new \Sentry\SentryBundle\SentryBundle(),
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

Note that, unlike before in version 3, the bundle will be enabled in all environments; event reporting, instead, is enabled
only when providing a DSN (see the next step).

## Configuration of the SDK

Add your [Sentry DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/quickstart/#configure-the-dsn) value of your project, if you have Symfony 3.4 add it to ``app/config/config_prod.yml`` for Symfony 4 or newer add the value to `config/packages/sentry.yaml`.
Keep in mind that leaving the `dsn` value empty (or undeclared) in other environments will effectively disable Sentry reporting.

```yaml
sentry:
    dsn: "https://public:secret@sentry.example.com/1"
    messenger: 
        enabled: true # flushes Sentry messages at the end of each message handling
        capture_soft_fails: true # captures exceptions marked for retry too
    options:
        environment: '%kernel.environment%'
        release: '%env(VERSION)%' #your app version
```

The parameter `options` allows to fine-tune exceptions. To discover more options, please refer to
[the Unified APIs](https://docs.sentry.io/development/sdk-dev/unified-api/#options) options and
the [PHP specific](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/#php-specific-options) ones.

#### Optional: use custom HTTP factory/transport

Since SDK 2.0 uses HTTPlug to remain transport-agnostic, you need to have installed two packages that provides 
[`php-http/async-client-implementation`](https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/async-client-implementation)
and [`psr/http-message-implementation`](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-message-implementation).

This bundle depends on `sentry/sdk`, which is a metapackage that already solves this need, requiring our suggested HTTP
packages: the Curl client and Guzzle's message factories.

If instead you want to use a different HTTP client or message factory, you can override the ``sentry/sdk`` package adding the following to your ``composer.json`` after the ``require`` section:
```json
    "replace": {
        "sentry/sdk": "*"
    }
```
This will prevent the installation of ``sentry/sdk`` package and will allow you to install through Composer the HTTP client or message factory of your choice.

For example for using Guzzle's components: 

```bash
composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter guzzlehttp/psr7
```

A possible alternate solution is using `pugx/sentry-sdk`, a metapackage that replaces `sentry/sdk` and uses `symfony/http-client` instead of `guzzlehttp/guzzle`:

```bash
composer require pugx/sentry-sdk
```

## Maintained versions

 * 4.x is actively maintained and developed on the master branch, and uses Sentry SDK 3.0;
 * 3.x is supported only for fixes and uses Sentry SDK 2.0;
 * 2.x is no longer maintained; from this version onwards it requires Symfony 3+ and PHP 7.1+;
 * 1.x is no longer maintained; you can use it for Symfony < 2.8 and PHP 5.6/7.0; 
 * 0.8.x is no longer maintained.

### Upgrading to 4.0

The 4.0 version of the bundle uses the newest version (3.x) of the underlying Sentry SDK. If you need to migrate from previous versions, please check the `UPGRADE-4.0.md` document.

#### Custom serializers

The option class_serializers can be used to send customized objects serialization.
```yml
sentry:
    options:
        class_serializers:
            YourValueObject: 'ValueObjectSerializer'
```

Several serializers can be added and the serializable check is done using **instanceof**. The serializer must implements the `__invoke` method returning an **array** with the information to send to sentry (class name is always sent).

Serializer example:
```php
final class ValueObjectSerializer
{
    public function __invoke(YourValueObject $vo): array
    {
        return [
            'value' => $vo->value()
        ];
    }
}
```
